Assingment Scope
This is the course project of the Practical Machine Learning Curse. The report develops how the goals of this projects are acomplished: 1. The data is cleaned to avoid using NA variables. 2. The 19622 experiments for training are divided by 70/30 for create the model and for test the results and for measure the accuracy. 3. A first model using classification tree is created, but the accuracy is not enought. 4. A final model is created using random forest which computes a 99% of accuracy, which is requiered to obtain a 95% of confidence for predincting 20 cases.

In order to improve the performance, the model is training using a k-fold=5 and processing in parallel. 5) As the accuracy of the used model is of 99%, we predict the 20 cases with a 95% of confidence.Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks.

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
